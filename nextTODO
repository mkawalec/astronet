- Get the client-side logging server-side: errors pushing from the client
  (which will conveniently get rid of ie8 errors:) )
- get the templates specify the plugin that goes in a given DOM element
  by data-plugin (applet? widget?) attribute
- wrap it all up in a neat little package and make it usable
